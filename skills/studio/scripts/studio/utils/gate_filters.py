"""The three safety filters -- reversibility, scope, blocker -- for the gate chain.

Each is a ``SafetyFilter`` (``gate_chain``): it may only **add** a stop. It returns ``CLEAR`` when
it sees no reason to stop, ``ADD_STOP`` when it requires one, and ``INDETERMINATE`` when it cannot
tell -- which the chain reads as a stop, so every "cannot tell" fails **closed**. None of them
removes a stop; that is the economy filter's job, below.

Alongside them is one **economy** filter -- ``PlanEconomyFilter`` -- which may only *remove* a stop,
by resolving the gate's declared key against the approved plan. The chain runs every safety filter
before it, and an added stop is final, so economy can never clear a stop safety required.

The order the chain runs them in, and the fact an added stop is final, is the whole safety
argument and lives in ``gate_chain.resolve_gate``; these are the individual judgements it composes.

They are pure of the runtime: each reads only its ``Gate``'s fields (populated by the runtime seam,
a later increment), so they are tested against constructed ``Gate``s. The one exception is that
reversibility asks git through ``armed_reversal`` and scope reads the plan off disk -- both are
read-only, never-raising probes whose failure is treated as ``INDETERMINATE``.

A ``Gate`` field left at its default carries **no information**, and every filter treats "no
information" as a stop, never as permission: an undetermined write set, an unknown checkout, an
unknown plan or active phase, an empty action all return ``INDETERMINATE``.
