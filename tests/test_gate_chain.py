"""The chain orders safety before economy, and a safety-added stop cannot be removed.

The one invariant a future contributor is most tempted to relax is that an autonomous
resolution is reachable only with every safety filter clear. It is bound here with fake
filters, because the real filters (scope, reversibility, blocker; already-answered,
plan-and-ledger) arrive in later increments and this skeleton must hold before them.
